  <h2>Inclusion Statement</h2>

  <p>
    At TransformGov Talks, we are committed to creating spaces where everyone feels welcomed, valued, and respected.
  </p>

  <p>
    We celebrate diversity in all its forms, and strive to be allies to LGBTQIA+ communities, people of all genders and gender identities, people with disabilities, neurodivergent people, people of every race, ethnicity, faith, and cultural background, and those from marginalised or under-represented groups.
  </p>

  <p>
    We recognise that genuine inclusion requires ongoing effort. We will continue to listen, learn, and adapt so that our events and online spaces are safe, accessible, and supportive for all.
