    <h2>About TransformGov Talks</h2>
    <p>There are lots of people in and around government who care about making it work better.</p>
    <p>TransformGov Talks provide a space for those people to meet. Each monthly meet-up features presentations and discussions about innovation in the public sector or great examples of impactful delivery of policy or services. This is followed by plenty of time to chat after - with free pizza!</p>
    <p>If you’ve ever been to UKGovCamp, OneTeamGov or similar events, you’ll know the energy that comes from meeting and sharing ideas with fellow reformers. We want to maintain that energy throughout the year by developing this new community.</p>
    <p>Whether you are (or used to be) a civil or public servant, an external consultant or practitioner; hail from academia, a think tank or civil society - if you care about reforming the public sector so it works better to serve the public, we’d love you to join us.</p>

      <div class="about-profile-text">
        <p>David is a long-time supporter of the government technology and transformation communities, starting with National Hack the Government Day and Young Rewired State back in 2009.</p>
        <p>Since then he has worked for mySociety, the Greater London Authority, HackIT (Hackney Council digital team) and most notably spent five years working for the Government Digital Service.</p>
        <p>David has been on the committee for GovCamp, the UK’s largest government-focused unconference, for several years, focusing on volunteer management.</p>
        <p>His main hopes for TransformGov Talks are (1) to ensure there is a good mix of future proposals and examples of real-world transformative delivery and (2) to reinvigorate the in-person government transformation community, which he feels has been lacking since the pandemic.</p>
