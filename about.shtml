      <p class="mt-4">There are lots of people in and around government who care about making it work better.</p>
      <p class="mt-4">TransformGov Talks provide a space for those people to meet. Each monthly meet-up features presentations and discussions about innovation in the public sector or great examples of impactful delivery of policy or services. This is followed by plenty of time to chat after - with free pizza!</p>
      <p class="mt-4">If you’ve ever been to UKGovCamp, OneTeamGov or similar events, you’ll know the energy that comes from meeting and sharing ideas with fellow reformers. We want to maintain that energy throughout the year by developing this new community.</p>
      <p class="mt-4">Whether you are (or used to be) a civil or public servant, an external consultant or practitioner; hail from academia, a think tank or civil society - if you care about reforming the public sector so it works better to serve the public, we’d love you to join us.</p>

              <p class="mt-4">David is a long-time supporter of the government technology and transformation communities, starting with National Hack the Government Day and Young Rewired State back in 2009.</P>
              <p class="mt-4">Since then he has worked for mySociety, the Greater London Authority, HackIT (Hackney Council digital team) and most notably spent five years working for the Government Digital Service.</p>
              <p class="mt-4">David has been on the committee for GovCamp, the UK’s largest government-focused unconference, for several years, focusing on volunteer management.</p>
              <p class="mt-4">His main hopes for TransformGov Talks are (1) to ensure there is a good mix of future proposals and examples of real-world transformative delivery and (2) to reinvigorate the in-person government transformation community, which he feels has been lacking since the pandemic.</p>

              Vijay is a 20 year practitioner in government and public service reform, working at the intersection of strategy, transformation and delivery supporting leaders involved in driving public services reform.  Prior to joining the Civil Service he was a roadie.
              </p>
              <p class="mt-4 text-base md:text-lg">
              He is the founder of Ceva, a challenger consultancy working with central and local government, the NHS, defence and education on complex change. More recently in his career he worked at PwC, PA Consulting and Capita and with a number of tech start-ups.  He has been involved in a range of large-scale reform efforts, including health system transformation internationally as well as national level transformation initiatives in defence, education and national security.
              </p>
              <p class="mt-4 text-base md:text-lg">
              Vijay has also served as a councillor, school governor and NHS Non-Executive Director and is a volunteer advisor to Kidney Research UK and Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity.
              </p>
              <p class="mt-4 text-base md:text-lg">
              Vijay is drawn to TransformGov Talks as a way of contributing to a thoughtful, practitioner-led space. He is particularly interested in learning from others about what really helps transformation stick in government and public services. He is interested in culture, capability, leadership and the realities of delivery rather than just the theory and in creating a space where honest stories are shared, orthodoxy is challenged and people working on change in government can learn from each other in an environment of psychological safety.

              <p class="mt-4">Linda has spent most of the last 15 years working at the ‘digital policy’ interface of central and local government in various roles at Government Digital Service, Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG), and more lately at TPXimpact.</P>
              <p class="mt-4">She has worked on collaborative digital ‘interventions’ aiming to solve common local public service challenges since 2012, leading the first Local Digital common product pilots at MHCLG, then the ‘Verify Local’ common patterns for local government at GDS. She led the Local Digital Declaration movement, set up MHCLG’s Local Digital programme and Fund in 2018, and later led the TPXimpact delivery partnership with the same programme.</p>
              <p class="mt-4">She now focuses on refining the practice of ‘market-shaping’, helping multidisciplinary teams to design and deliver sector-led interventions that re-shape how local service markets behave.</p>
              <p class="mt-4">Outside of Government roles, Linda has led development planning work Haiti, product development for the first release of Uniti Network’s service in Ghana, and circular economy systems design projects.</p>
